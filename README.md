# CSE-601-Data_Mining
Data Mining projects on bioinformatic topic (implmented in Python)
##
## 1) Project - PCA & Appriori Algorithm
**Problem:** This project contains 2 parts. First part is to implement the PCA (Principle Components Analysis) algorithm, project the high-dimensional data to 2 dimensions, and plot the 2-dimensional data points. Second part is on implementing Apriori
algorithm and rule generation algorithm
